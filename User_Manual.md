### How to run and use the Fashion Clothing Image Generator?

- Make sure you have installed all the required packages mentioned in the **Preparation** section above; 
- Run the `Project_Group_1.py` file by
  `python3 Project_Group_1.py`
- Check your terminal says `Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)`;
- Use your browser to visit the web page on your localhost: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/);
- follow the instruction on the web page (step1, step2);
- Press `CTRL+C` in terminal to quit.

### How view dataset, train and validate models?

> **Note**: 
> We have tried 5 different models, **original provided GAN**, **Conditional GAN**, **Conditional Deep Convolutional GAN (cDCGAN)**, **Conditional 'Partial' Convolutional GAN (c'P'CGAN)**, **Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ACGAN)**. 
> The **ACGAN** model is our final model, which is used in the project.


1. Open the `ACGAN.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook on local machine;
2. In the **first code cell**, please **set proper `device`** according to your machine.
3. Run all cells in the `ACGAN.ipynb` file;
4. You may also try other models which are in the `originalGAN`, `cGAN`, `cDCGAN`, `cPCGAN` folders.
